## Introduction

```

- On Monday, we talked about the Beta-Binomial model for binary outcomes with an unknown probability of success, $\pi$.

- We will now discuss sequentality in Bayesian analyses.

- Working example: 
    - In Alison Bechdel's 1985 comic strip The Rule, a character states that they only see a movie if it satisfies the following three rules (Bechdel 1986):
        - the movie has to have at least two women in it;
        - these two women talk to each other; and
        - they talk about something besides a man.

    - Thinking of movies you've watched, what percentage of all recent movies do you think pass the Bechdel test? Is it closer to 10%, 50%, 80%, or 100%?

## Introduction: Example

- Let  $\pi$, a random value between 0 and 1, denote the unknown proportion of recent movies that pass the Bechdel test. 

- Three friends (feminist, clueless, and optimist) have some prior ideas about $\pi$.
    - Reflecting upon movies that he has seen in the past, the feminist understands that the majority lack strong women characters. 
    - The clueless doesn’t really recall the movies they've seen, and so are unsure whether passing the Bechdel test is common or uncommon. 
    - Lastly, the optimist thinks that the Bechdel test is a really low bar for the representation of women in film, and thus assumes almost all movies pass the test. 
    
## Introduction: Example

- Graph the following priors:

```{r}
#| eval: false
plot_beta(alpha = 1, beta = 1)
plot_beta(alpha = 5, beta = 11)
plot_beta(alpha = 14, beta = 1)
```    
    
- Which prior belongs to each friend?
    - Reflecting upon movies that he has seen in the past, the feminist understands that the majority lack strong women characters. 
    - The clueless doesn’t really recall the movies they've seen, and so are unsure whether passing the Bechdel test is common or uncommon. 
    - Lastly, the optimist thinks that the Bechdel test is a really low bar for the representation of women in film, and thus assumes almost all movies pass the test. 

## Introduction: Example

- The clueless doesn't really recall the movies they've seen, and so are unsure whether passing the Bechdel test is common or uncommon. 

```{r, fig.align="center"}
#| echo: false
plot_beta(alpha = 1, beta = 1) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("Beta(1, 1)")
```

## Introduction: Example

- Reflecting upon movies that he has seen in the past, the feminist understands that the majority lack strong women characters. 

```{r, fig.align="center"}
#| echo: false
plot_beta(alpha = 5, beta = 11) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("Beta(5, 11)")
```

## Introduction: Example

- Lastly, the optimist thinks that the Bechdel test is a really low bar for the representation of women in film, and thus assumes almost all movies pass the test.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
#| echo: false
plot_beta(alpha = 14, beta = 1) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("Beta(14, 1)")
```

## Introduction: Example

- The analysts agree to review a sample of $n$ recent movies and record $Y$, the number that pass the Bechdel test. 
    - Because the outcome is yes/no, the binomial distribution is appropriate for the data distribution.
    - We aren't sure what the population proportion, $\pi$, is, so we will not restrict it to a fixed value. 
        - Because we know $\pi \in [0, 1]$, the beta distribution is appropriate for the prior distribution.
    
$$
\begin{align*}
Y|\pi &\sim \text{Bin}(n, \pi) \\
\pi &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)
\end{align*}
$$

## Introduction: Example

- Because we know $\pi \in [0, 1]$, the beta distribution is appropriate for the prior distribution.
    
$$
\begin{align*}
Y|\pi &\sim \text{Bin}(n, \pi) \\
\pi &\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)
\end{align*}
$$

- From the previous chapter, we know that this results in the following posterior distribution

$$
\pi | (Y=y) \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha+y, \beta+n-y)
$$

## Introduction: Example

- Wait!!
    - Everyone gets their own prior?
    - ... is there a "correct" prior?
    - ...... is the Bayesian world always this subjective?
    
## Introduction: Example

- More clearly defined questions that we *can* actually answer:
    - To what extent might different priors lead the analysts to three different posterior conclusions about the Bechdel test? 
        - How might this depend upon the sample size and outcomes of the movie data they collect? 
    - To what extent will the analysts' posterior understandings evolve as they collect more and more data? 
    - Will they ever come to agreement about the representation of women in film?! 
    
## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors
    
```{r, fig.align="center"}
#| echo: false
ggarrange(plot_beta(alpha = 1, beta = 1) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("Beta(1, 1)") + ylim(0,15),
          plot_beta(alpha = 5, beta = 11) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("Beta(5, 11)") + ylim(0,15),
          plot_beta(alpha = 14, beta = 1) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("Beta(14, 1)") + ylim(0,15),
          ncol = 3)
```

- The differing prior means show disagreement about whether $\pi$ is closer to 0 or 1.

- The differing levels of prior variability show that the analysts have different degrees of certainty in their prior information. 

## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

```{r, fig.align="center"}
#| echo: false
plot_beta(alpha = 14, beta = 1) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("Beta(14, 1)") + ylim(0,15)
```

- **Informative prior**: reflects specific information about the unknown variable with high certainty, i.e., low variability.
    
## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

```{r, fig.align="center"}
#| echo: false
plot_beta(alpha = 1, beta = 1) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("Beta(14, 1)") + ylim(0,15)
```

- **Vague or diffuse prior**:  reflects little specific information about the unknown variable. 
    - A **flat prior**, which assigns equal prior plausibility to all possible values of the variable, is a special case.
    - This is effectively saying "🤷."
    
## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- Okay, great - we have different priors.
    - How do the different priors affect the posterior?
    
- We have data from FiveThirtyEight, reporting results of the Bechdel test.

```{r}
#| echo: false
set.seed(65821)
bechdel20 <- bayesrules::bechdel %>% sample_n(20)
head(bechdel20, n = 5)
```

## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- So how many pass the test in this sample?

```{r}
bechdel20 %>% tabyl(binary) %>% adorn_totals("row")
```

## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- Let's look at the graphs of just the prior and likelihood.

```{r}
#| eval: false
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 5, beta = 11, y = 9, n = 20, posterior = FALSE) + theme_bw()
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 1, beta = 1, y = 9, n = 20, posterior = FALSE) + theme_bw()
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 14, beta = 1, y = 9, n = 20, posterior = FALSE) + theme_bw()
```

- Questions to think about:

    - Whose posterior do you anticipate will look the most like the scaled likelihood? 
    - Whose do you anticipate will look the least like the scaled likelihood?

## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- Let's look at the graphs of just the prior and likelihood.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
#| echo: false
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 5, beta = 11, y = 9, n = 20, posterior = FALSE) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("The feminist: Beta(5, 11)")
```

## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- Let's look at the graphs of just the prior and likelihood.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
#| echo: false
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 1, beta = 1, y = 9, n = 20, posterior = FALSE) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("The clueless: Beta(1, 1)") 
```


## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- Let's look at the graphs of just the prior and likelihood.

```{r, fig.align="center"}
#| echo: false
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 14, beta = 1, y = 9, n = 20, posterior = FALSE) + theme_bw() + ggtitle("The optimist: Beta(14, 1)") 
```

## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- Find the posterior distributions. (i.e., What are the updated parameters?)

- Let's now explore what the posteriors look like.

```{r}
#| eval: false
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 5, beta = 11, y = 9, n = 20) + theme_bw()

```

## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- In addition to priors affecting our posterior distributions... the data also affects it.

- Let's now consider three new analysts: they all share the optimistic Beta(14, 1) for $\pi$, however, they have access to different data.
    - Morteza reviews $n = 13$ movies from the year 1991, among which  $Y=6$ (about 46%) pass the Bechdel.
    - Nadide reviews $n = 63$ movies from the year 2001, among which  $Y=29$ (about 46%) pass the Bechdel.
    - Ursula reviews $n = 99$ movies from the year 2013, among which  $Y=46$ (about 46%) pass the Bechdel.
    
- How will the different data affect the posterior distributions?

## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- How will the different data affect the posterior distributions?

```{r}
#| eval: false
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 14, beta = 1, y = 6, n = 13) + theme_bw()
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 14, beta = 1, y = 29, n = 63) + theme_bw()
plot_beta_binomial(alpha = 14, beta = 1, y = 46, n = 99) + theme_bw()
```    
    
- Which posterior is the most in sync with their data?

- Which posterior is the least in sync with their data?

```{r, fig.align="center"}

```

```   
    
## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

```

## Different Priors $\to$ Different Posteriors

- What did we observe?
    - As $n \to \infty$, variance in the likelihood $\to 0$.
        - In Morteza's small sample of 13 movies, the likelihood function is wide.
        - In Ursula's larger sample size of 99 movies, the likelihood function is narrower.
    - We see that the narrower the likelihood, the more influence the data holds over the posterior. 
    
## Striking a Balance

![](images/W07-L2-a.png){fig-align="center"}        

- Overall message: no matter the strength of and discrepancies among their prior understanding of $\pi$, analysts will come to a common posterior understanding in light of strong data.

## Striking a Balance

- The posterior can either favor the data or the prior.
    - The rate at which the posterior balance tips in favor of the data depends upon the *prior*. 
    
- Left to right on the graph, the sample size increases from $n=13$ to $n=99$ movies, while preserving the proportion that pass ($\approx$ 0.46).
    - The likelihood's insistence and the data's influence over the posterior increase with sample size.
    - This also means that the influence of our prior understanding diminishes as we gather new data.

- Top to bottom on the graph, priors move from informative (Beta(14,1)) to vague (Beta(1,1)).
    - Naturally, the more informative the prior, the greater its influence on the posterior.
  
## Introduction: Sequentiality

- Let's now turn our thinking to - okay, we've updated our beliefs... but now we have new data!

- The evolution in our posterior understanding happens incrementally, as we accumulate new data. 
    - Scientists' understanding of climate change has evolved over the span of decades as they gain new information.
    - Presidential candidates' understanding of their chances of winning an election evolve over months as new poll results become available. 
    
## Introduction: Sequentiality
    
- Let's revisit Milgram's behavioral study of obedience from Chapter 3. Recall, $\pi$ represents the proportion of people that will obey authority, even if it means bringing harm to others. 
    
- Prior to Milgram's experiments, our fictional psychologist expected that few people would obey authority in the face of harming another: $\pi \sim \text{Beta}(1,10)$.

- Now, suppose that the psychologist collected the data incrementally, day by day, over a three-day period. 

- Find the following posterior distributions, each building off the last:
    - Day 0: $\text{Beta}(1,10)$.
    - Day 1: $Y=1$ out of $n=10$.
    - Day 2: $Y=17$ out of $n=20$.
    - Day 3: $Y=8$ out of $n=10$.
    
## Introduction: Sequentiality

- Find the following posterior distributions, each building off the last:

    - Day 0: $\text{Beta}(1,10)$.
    - Day 1: $Y=1$ out of $n=10$: <font color = "#cf63cd">$\text{Beta}(1,10) \to \text{Beta}(2, 19)$.</font>
    - Day 2: $Y=17$ out of $n=20$: <font color = "#cf63cd">$\text{Beta}(2, 19) \to \text{Beta}(19, 22)$.</font>
    - Day 3: $Y=8$ out of $n=10$: <font color = "#cf63cd">$\text{Beta}(19, 22) \to \text{Beta}(27, 24)$.</font> 
    
- Recall from Chapter 3, our posterior was $\text{Beta}(27,24)$!    

## Sequential Bayesian Analysis or Bayesian Learning

- In a sequential Bayesian analysis, a posterior model is updated incrementally as more data come in. 
    - With each new piece of data, the previous posterior model reflecting our understanding prior to observing this data becomes the new prior model.
    
- This is why we love Bayesian! 
    - We evolve our thinking as new data come in. 
    
- These types of sequential analyses also uphold two fundamental properties:
    1. The final posterior model is data order invariant,     
    2. The final posterior only depends upon the cumulative data.

## Sequential Bayesian Analysis or Bayesian Learning

- In order:
    - Day 0: $\text{Beta}(1,10)$.
    - Day 1: $Y=1$ out of $n=10$: <font color = "#cf63cd">$\text{Beta}(1,10) \to \text{Beta}(2, 19)$.</font>
    - Day 2: $Y=17$ out of $n=20$: <font color = "#cf63cd">$\text{Beta}(2, 19) \to \text{Beta}(19, 22)$.</font>
    - Day 3: $Y=8$ out of $n=10$: <font color = "#cf63cd">$\text{Beta}(19, 22) \to \text{Beta}(27, 24)$.</font>  
    
- Out of order:
    - Day 0: $\text{Beta}(1,10)$.
    - Day 3: $Y=8$ out of $n=10$: <font color = "#cf63cd">$\text{Beta}(1,10) \to \text{Beta}(9, 12)$.</font>
    - Day 2: $Y=17$ out of $n=20$: <font color = "#cf63cd">$\text{Beta}(9, 12) \to \text{Beta}(26, 15)$.</font>
    - Day 1: $Y=1$ out of $n=10$: <font color = "#cf63cd">$\text{Beta}(26, 15) \to \text{Beta}(27, 24)$.</font>

## Example: Mario Kart

- In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, item boxes give different items depending on race position. To reduce the "position bias," only item boxes opened while the racer was in mid-pack (positions 4–10) were recorded. 

- You want to estimate the probability that an item box yields a Red Shell. When playing the Special Cup, only 31 red shells were seen in 114 boxes opened by mid-pack racers.

- Find the posterior distribution under two priors:
    1. Flat/uninformative prior, Beta(1,1).
    2. Beta($\alpha$, $\beta$) of your choosing.
    
- How different are the posterior distributions?    
    

## Example: Mario Kart

- Suppose that we know the individual data points for the Special Cup:
    - Cloudtop Cruise, of 28 boxes, 6 had a red shell.
    - Bone-Dry Dunes, of 27 boxes, 8 had a red shell.
    - Bowser's Castle, of 29 boxes, 12 had a red shell.
    - Rainbow Road, of 30 boxes, 5 had a red shell.

- Prove sequentiality to yourself.

    - Analyze the data race-by-race in this order: Cloudtop Cruise, Bone-Dry Dunes, Bowser's Castle, and Rainbow Road.
    
    - Analyze the data race-by-race in this order: Rainbow Road, Bowser's Castle, Cloudtop Cruise, and Bone-Dry Dunes.

## Wrap Up

- Today we have discussed balance and sequentiality.

- Remember that order of data inclusion does not matter -- we will end up with the same posterior.

- We have seen that prior specification "matters" but there will not be a large difference in the posterior distribution when priors are more similar to one another.

- Next week:
    - Gamma-Poisson
    - Normal-Normal
    - What to do with the posterior distribution.
