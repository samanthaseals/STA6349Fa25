TThe resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated Assignment on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nProject (50%): Students in this course will be collaborating with students in GEO6118 - Research Design. The final research project will be submitted along with smaller pieces throughout the semester.\nFinal Exam (25%): The final exam will be a take home final.\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nAssigments have due dates, however, the dropboxes will not close until the end of the semester. All students are automatically granted “extensions” without question.\nNote that if there is not a submission when I go to grade (after the initial deadline), I will assign a zero (0) and request that you submit the assignment when you are able to. This is only for record keeping purposes. There is no penalty for submitting late and a full grade will be given upon review of your submission.\nExtensions are not available for project pieces or the final exam."
