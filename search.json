His parking times are generally right-skewed as it is much more common for it to take a shorter amount of time… but every now and then it can take quite a while.

Her performances at the local art venue are known for their spontaneity and lack of strict timing. Observers have noted that the duration of her performances can last anywhere between 15 and 30 minutes, with any length within this interval being equally likely. There’s no predicting exactly how long Maude will choose to perform on any given night… sometimes it’s a brief expression and sometimes it stretches to the edge of the audience’s patience.\na.

The Dude always orders a White Russian when he’s at the bowling alley. However, the bowling alley bar is not always well-stocked. Each time The Dude places an order, there is only a 60% chance that the bartender has all the necessary ingredients on hand to make the drink (they are frequently out of cream). Throughout one particularly long evening of bowling and philosophical debates, The Dude orders 8 White Russians. He hopes that most of them will be successfully made.\na.

While the exact length can vary from game to game, it’s rare for his games to be extremely short or unusually long. Most of the time, his game lengths cluster fairly tightly around that 45-minute mark, though occasionally he’ll have a quicker match or one that drags on a little longer if the vibe calls for it, to the tune of \\pm 5 minutes.\na.

He knows he’s not perfect, but he’s developed a pretty good feel for his overall strike success rate. It seems like his strike percentage tends to hang out somewhere between 60% and 80% most nights, though there’s still some uncertainty. Sometimes he’s on fire, sometimes he’s a little off, but overall he’s confident his long-term strike rate leans more toward success than failure.\na. What is the random variable of interest?

TThe resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated Assignment on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nProject (50%): Students in this course will be collaborating with students in GEO6118 - Research Design. The final research project will be submitted along with smaller pieces throughout the semester.\nFinal Exam (25%): The final exam will be a take home final.\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nAssigments have due dates, however, the dropboxes will not close until the end of the semester. All students are automatically granted “extensions” without question.\nNote that if there is not a submission when I go to grade (after the initial deadline), I will assign a zero (0) and request that you submit the assignment when you are able to. This is only for record keeping purposes. There is no penalty for submitting late and a full grade will be given upon review of your submission.\nExtensions are not available for project pieces or the final exam."
